## Real-time Remote Based Supply Water Quality Testing System

This project was done as a part of `CSE 316: Microcontroller, Microprocessor and Embedded System` course offered by BUET CSE. I, along with three other teammates: @mashiat, @rifat, @naeem worked on the project under the supervision of **Dr. A.B.M Alim Al Islam**.

You will find a detailed information regarding this project on my blog [here](https://fazledyn.github.io/posts/supply-water-quality-system/). A YouTube video is also available involving the demonstration of the project: https://youtu.be/lDYQptpVHn4.
